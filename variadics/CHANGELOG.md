## 0.0.7 (2024-11-08)

### Chore

 - <csr-id-d5677604e93c07a5392f4229af94a0b736eca382/> update pinned rust version, clippy lints, remove some dead code

### New Features

 - <csr-id-f7e740fb2ba36d0fcf3fd196d60333552911e3a4/> generalized hash trie indexes for relational tuples
   Generalized Hash Tries are part of the SIGMOD '23 FreeJoin
   [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3589295) by
   Wang/Willsey/Suciu. They provide a compressed ("factorized")
   representation of relations. By operating in the factorized domain, join
   algorithms can defer cross-products and achieve asymptotically optimal
   performance.
   
   ---------
 - <csr-id-1c2825942f8a326699a7fb68b5372b49918851b5/> additions to variadics including collection types
   adds a number of features:
   
   collection types for variadics (sets, multisets) that allow search via
   RefVars (variadic of refs)
   into_option (convert a variadic to a variadic of options)
   into_vec (convert a variadic to a variadic of vecs)
 - <csr-id-8afd3266dac43c04c3fc29065a13c9c9a6a55afe/> additions to variadics including collection types
   adds a number of features:
   - collection types for variadics (sets, multisets) that allow search via
   RefVars (variadic of refs)
   - into_option (convert a variadic to a variadic of options)
   - into_vec (convert a variadic to a variadic of vecs)

### Style

 - <csr-id-47cb703e771f7d1c451ceb9d185ada96410949da/> fixes for nightly clippy
   a couple few spurious `too_many_arguments` and a spurious
   `zombie_processes` still on current nightly (`clippy 0.1.84 (4392847410
   2024-10-21)`)

### Test

 - <csr-id-656ee328c8710bce7370c851437a80ca3db46a5a/> ignore trybuild tests inconsistent on latest nightly

### New Features

 - <csr-id-20080cb7ceb5b5d3ba349dfd822a37288e40add6/> add traits for dealing with variadics of references
   Renames some traits, but not a breaking change since there hasn't been a
   release that includes those traits.
 - <csr-id-b92dfc7460c985db6935e79d612f42b9b87e746f/> add `iter_any_ref` and `iter_any_mut` to `VariadicsExt`
   Depends on #1241
   
   This isn't needed for the current GHT implementation, but is useful in
   general
 - <csr-id-1a6228f2db081af68890e2e64b3a91f15dd9214f/> add traits for referencing variadics
   This adds a way to convert a reference to a variadic into a variadic of
   references. I.e. `&var_expr!(a, b, c) -> var_expr!(&a, &b, &c)`

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-bbef0705d509831415d3bb5ce003116af06b6ffb/> `EitherRefVariadic` is `Variadic`

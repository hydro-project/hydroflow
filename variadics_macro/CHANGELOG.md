## v0.5.5 (2024-11-08)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-f7e740fb2ba36d0fcf3fd196d60333552911e3a4/> generalized hash trie indexes for relational tuples
   Generalized Hash Tries are part of the SIGMOD '23 FreeJoin
   [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3589295) by
   Wang/Willsey/Suciu. They provide a compressed ("factorized")
   representation of relations. By operating in the factorized domain, join
   algorithms can defer cross-products and achieve asymptotically optimal
   performance.

## v0.4.0 (2024-11-08)

### Chore

 - <csr-id-d5677604e93c07a5392f4229af94a0b736eca382/> update pinned rust version, clippy lints, remove some dead code

### New Features

 - <csr-id-afe78c343658472513b34d28658634b253148aee/> add ability to have staged flows inside unit tests
   Whenever a Hydroflow+ program is compiled, it depends on a generated
   `__staged` module, which contains the entire contents of the crate but
   with every type / function made `pub` and exported, so that the compiled
   UDFs can resolve local references appropriately.
   
   Previously, we would not do this for `#[cfg(test)]` modules, since they
   may use `dev-dependencies` and therefore the generated module may fail
   to compile when not in test mode. To solve this, when running a unit
   test (marked with `hydroflow_plus::deploy::init_test()`) that uses
   trybuild, we emit a version of the `__staged` module with `#[cfg(test)]`
   modules included _into the generated trybuild sources_ because we can
   guarantee via trybuild that the appropriate `dev-dependencies` are
   available.
   
   This by itself allows crates depending on `hydroflow_plus` to have local
   unit tests with Hydroflow+ logic inside them. But we also want to use
   this support for unit tests inside `hydroflow_plus` itself. To enable
   that, we eliminate the `hydroflow_plus_deploy` crate and move its
   contents directly to `hydroflow_plus` itself so that we can access the
   trybuild machinery without incurring a circular dependency.
   
   Also fixes #1408

## v0.1.1 (2024-04-05)

<csr-id-7958fb0d900be8fe7359326abfa11dcb8fb35e8a/>

### New Features

 - <csr-id-77f3e5afb9e276d1d6c643574ebac75ed0003939/> simplify lifetime bounds for processes and clusters
   feat(hydroflow_plus): simplify lifetime bounds for processes and
   clusters
   
   This allows `extract` to move the flow builder, which is a prerequisite
   for having developers run the optimizer during deployment as well in
   case it changes the network topology.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-6cc5a7f78fc8bd28f32dad58857ccd1c46bc93cd/> handle multiple references to copy-able free variables
 - <csr-id-54b4ee3fc847db14a0b825e04eae6e1288d44af3/> ignore unnecessary lifetime lint on entrypoints

## v0.1.0 (2024-01-29)

### Documentation

 - <csr-id-3b36020d16792f26da4df3c5b09652a4ab47ec4f/> actually committing empty CHANGELOG.md is required

### New Features

 - <csr-id-af6e3be60fdb69ceec1613347910f4dd49980d34/> push down persists and implement Pi example
   Also fixes type inference issues with reduce the same way as we did for fold.
 - <csr-id-71083233afc01e0132d7186f4af8c0b4a6323ec7/> support crates that have no entrypoints
   Also includes various bugfixes needed for Hydroflow+.
 - <csr-id-e5bdd12e32d6ea72fd91a55c12e09f07a0edaa5c/> add initial test using Hydro CLI from Hydroflow+
   This also required a change to Hydroflow core to make it possible to run the dataflow itself on a single thread (using a LocalSet), even if the surrounding runtime is not single-threaded (required to work around deadlocks because we can't use async APIs inside Hydroflow+). This requires us to spawn any Hydroflow tasks (only for `dest_sink` at the moment) right next to when we run the dataflow rather than when the Hydroflow graph is initialized. From a conceptual perspective, this seems _more right_, since now creating a Hydroflow program will not result in any actual tasks running.
   
   In the third PR of this series, I aim to add a new Hydroflow+ operator that will automate the setup of a `dest_sink`/`source_stream` pair that span nodes.
 - <csr-id-8b635683e5ac3c4ed2d896ae88e2953db1c6312c/> add a functional surface syntax using staging

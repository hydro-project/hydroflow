### Chore

 - <csr-id-d5677604e93c07a5392f4229af94a0b736eca382/> update pinned rust version, clippy lints, remove some dead code

### New Features

 - <csr-id-8a809315cd37929687fcabc34a12042db25d5767/> add API for external network inputs
   This is a key step towards being able to unit-test HF+ graphs, by being
   able to have controlled inputs. Outputs next.
 - <csr-id-60d9becaf0b67f9819316ce6d76bd867f7d46505/> splice UDFs with type hints to avoid inference failures

### Style

 - <csr-id-47cb703e771f7d1c451ceb9d185ada96410949da/> fixes for nightly clippy
   a couple few spurious `too_many_arguments` and a spurious
   `zombie_processes` still on current nightly (`clippy 0.1.84 (4392847410
   2024-10-21)`)

## v0.4.0 (2024-08-30)

<csr-id-11af32828bab6e4a4264d2635ff71a12bb0bb778/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-11af32828bab6e4a4264d2635ff71a12bb0bb778/> lower min dependency versions where possible, update `Cargo.lock`
   Moved from #1418
   
   ---------

### New Features

 - <csr-id-46a8a2cb08732bb21096e824bc4542d208c68fb2/> use trybuild to compile subgraph binaries

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-06c514179bacafb52aceaed4c92367176c656822/> typing hole when splicing `RuntimeData`
   Previously, a `RuntimeData` could be spliced in any context even if its
   data type may not be valid under the required `'a` lifetime constraint.
   This fixed that typing bug.
   
   Soon, we should have regression testing for this via trybuild.

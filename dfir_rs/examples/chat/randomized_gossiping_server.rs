/// The implementation is based on "Epidemic algorithms for replicated database maintenance"
/// (https://dl.acm.org/doi/epdf/10.1145/41840.41841). Specifically, it implements push-based
/// "rumor-mongering" with a blind-coin removal process described below.
///
/// At every "cycle" a server chooses, randomly, one peer from a group of five servers. It then
/// "pushes" all the "rumors" (messages) that it has heard so far to that peer. This is how new
/// messages propagate through the system. Without a removal process, the messages would bounce
/// around forever.
///
/// A "blind-coin" removal process is used. After a server gossips the known rumors with randomly
/// selected peers, each message is dropped with a 1/K probability. K can be configured by changing
/// [REMOVAL_PROBABILITY]. The removal is "blind" because the server doesn't check if the receiving
/// peer already knew the message, i.e. it doesn't rely on a feedback mechanism from the peer to
/// drive the process. The removal is "coin" based because it relies on pure chance (instead of
/// keeping track using a counter).
///
/// To keep things simple, the peer-group of servers is based on static membership - it contains
/// 5 members that communicate with each other on fixed ports.

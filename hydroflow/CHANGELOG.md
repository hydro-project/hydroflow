 - <csr-id-11a12b2daa3496ed36af4ca78d87454411da3839/> update example-1, write first half of example-2
 - <csr-id-eebd4075e83808d51b40b4850e60ddba52f5862c/> pull benchmark into separate file
   Also remove the reporting of latency information for now, since it was
   vulnerable to coordinated omission and is not reliable.

   Still pretty simple, but the beginnings of a configurable benchmarking harness
   for the KVS.

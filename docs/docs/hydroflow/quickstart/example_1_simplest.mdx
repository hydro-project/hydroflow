# Simplest Example

> In this example we will cover:
> - Modifying the Hydroflow template project
> - How Hydroflow program specs are embedded inside Rust
> - How to execute a simple Hydroflow program
> - Two Hydroflow operators: `source_iter` and `for_each`

Lets start out with the simplest possible Hydroflow program, which prints out
the numbers in `0..10`.

Create a clean template project:
```console
#shell-command-next-line
cargo generate gh:hydro-project/hydroflow template/hydroflow
‚ö†Ô∏è   Favorite `gh:hydro-project/hydroflow` not found in config, using it as a git repository: https://github.com/hydro-project/hydroflow.git
ü§∑   Project Name: simple
üîß   Destination: /Users/me/code/simple ...
üîß   project-name: simple ...
üîß   Generating template ...
[11/11]   Done: src
üîß   Moving generated files into: `<dir>/simple`...
üí°   Initializing a fresh Git repository
‚ú®   Done! New project created <dir>/simple
```

After `cd`ing into the generated folder, ensure the correct nightly version of rust is installed, and test the generated project:
```bash
#shell-command-next-line
rustup update
#shell-command-next-line
cargo test
```

Then edit the `src/main.rs` file, replacing
*all* of its contents with the following code:

<CodeBlock language="rust" showLineNumbers>{exampleCode}</CodeBlock>

And then run the program:

<CodeBlock language="console">{extractOutput(exampleOutput)}</CodeBlock>

## Understanding the Code
Although this is a trivial program, it's useful to go through it line by line.

<CodeBlock language="rust">{getLines(exampleCode, 'use')}</CodeBlock>

This import gives you the macro you need from Hydroflow to write code in Hydroflow's
[_surface syntax_](../syntax).

Next, inside the main method we specify a flow by calling the
`hydroflow_syntax!` macro. We assign the resulting `Hydroflow` instance to
a mutable variable `flow`‚Äì‚Äìmutable because we will be changing its status when we run it.
<CodeBlock language="rust">{getLines(exampleCode, 'macro_call')}</CodeBlock>

Hydroflow surface syntax defines a "flow" consisting of *operators* connected via `->` arrows.
This simplest example uses a simple two-step linear flow.
It starts with a [`source_iter`](../syntax/surface_ops_gen#source_iter) operator that takes the Rust
iterator `0..10` and iterates it to emit the
numbers 0 through 9. That operator then passes those numbers along the `->` arrow downstream to a
[`for_each`](../syntax/surface_ops_gen#for_each) operator that invokes its closure argument to print each
item passed in.

The Hydroflow surface syntax is merely a *specification*; it does not actually do anything
until we run it.
We can run this flow from within Rust via the [`run_available()` method](https://hydro-project.github.io/hydroflow/doc/hydroflow/scheduled/graph/struct.Hydroflow.html#method.run_available).

<CodeBlock language="rust">{getLines(exampleCode, 'run')}</CodeBlock>

Note that `run_available()` runs the Hydroflow graph until no more work is immediately
available. In this example flow, running the graph drains the iterator completely, so no
more work will *ever* be available. In future examples we will use external inputs such as
network ingress, in which case more work might appear at any time.

In server applications that use network ingress for inputs, new work can appear at any time. In these application
we may need a different method than `run_available()`, e.g. the [`run_async()`](https://hydro-project.github.io/hydroflow/doc/hydroflow/scheduled/graph/struct.Hydroflow.html#method.run_async) method, check [the networking
examples](./example_7_networking) for more.

### A Note on Project Structure
The template project is intended to be a starting point for your own Hydroflow project, and you can add files and directories as you see fit. The only requirement is that the `src/main.rs` file exists and contains a `main()` function.

In this simplest example we did not use a number of the files in the template: notably everything in the `src/` subdirectory other than `src/main.rs`. If you'd like to delete those extraneous files you can do so, but it's not necessary, and we'll use them in subsequent examples.

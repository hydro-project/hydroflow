# Simplest Example

> In this example we will cover:

> - Two Hydroflow operators: `source_iter` and `for_each`

Lets start out with the simplest possible Hydroflow program, which prints out
the numbers in `0..10`.

Create a clean template project:
```console
#shell-command-next-line
cargo generate hydro-project/hydroflow-template
⚠️   Favorite `hydro-project/hydroflow-template` not found in config, using it as a git repository: https://github.com/hydro-project/hydroflow-template.git
🤷   Project Name: simple
🔧   Destination: /Users/jmh/code/sussudio/simple ...
🔧   project-name: simple ...
🔧   Generating template ...
[11/11]   Done: src
🔧   Moving generated files into: `<dir>/simple`...
💡   Initializing a fresh Git repository
✨   Done! New project created <dir>/simple
```

Change directory into the resulting `simple` folder or open it in your IDE. Then edit the `src/main.rs` file, replacing
*all* of its contents with the following code:

<CodeBlock language="rust" showLineNumbers>{exampleCode}</CodeBlock>

And then run the program:

<CodeBlock language="console">{extractOutput(exampleOutput)}</CodeBlock>

## Understanding the Code
Although this is a trivial program, it's useful to go through it line by line.

<CodeBlock language="rust">{getLines(exampleCode, 1)}</CodeBlock>

This import gives you everything you need from Hydroflow to write code with Hydroflow's
[_surface syntax_](../syntax).

Next, inside the main method we specify a flow by calling the
`hydroflow_syntax!` macro. We assign the resulting `Hydroflow` instance to
a mutable variable `flow`––mutable because we will be changing its status when we run it.
<CodeBlock language="rust">{getLines(exampleCode, 3, 6)}</CodeBlock>

Hydroflow surface syntax defines a "flow" consisting of *operators* connected via `->` arrows.
This simplest example uses a simple two-step linear flow.
It starts with a [`source_iter`](../syntax/surface_ops_gen#source_iter) operator that takes the Rust
iterator `0..10` and iterates it to emit the
numbers 0 through 9. That operator then passes those numbers along the `->` arrow downstream to a
[`for_each`](../syntax/surface_ops_gen#for_each) operator that invokes its closure argument to print each
item passed in.

The Hydroflow surface syntax is merely a *specification*; it does not actually do anything
until we run it.
We can run this flow from within Rust via the [`run_available()` method](https://hydro-project.github.io/hydroflow/doc/hydroflow/scheduled/graph/struct.Hydroflow.html#method.run_available).

<CodeBlock language="rust">{getLines(exampleCode, 8)}</CodeBlock>

Note that `run_available()` runs the Hydroflow graph until no more work is immediately
available. In this example flow, running the graph drains the iterator completely, so no
more work will *ever* be available. In future examples we will use external inputs such as
network ingress, in which case more work might appear at any time. In those examples we may need a different method than `run_available()`, 
e.g. the [`run_async()`](https://hydro-project.github.io/hydroflow/doc/hydroflow/scheduled/graph/struct.Hydroflow.html#method.run_async) method,
which we'll see
in [the EchoServer example](./example_7_echo_server).

### A Note on Project Structure
The template project is intended to be a starting point for your own Hydroflow project, and you can add files and directories as you see fit. The only requirement is that the `src/main.rs` file exists and contains a `main()` function.

In this simplest example we did not use a number of the files in the template: notably everything in the `src/` subdirectory other than `src/main.rs`. If you'd like to delete those extraneous files you can do so, but it's not necessary, and we'll use them in subsequent examples.

# DFIR Surface Syntax
The natural way to write a DFIR program is using the _Surface Syntax_ documented here.
It is a chained `Iterator`-style syntax of operators built into DFIR that should be sufficient
for most uses. If you want lower-level access you can work with the `Core API` documented in the [Architecture](../architecture/) section.

In this chapter we go over the syntax piece by piece: how to [embed surface syntax in Rust](./surface_embedding) and how to specify [_flows_](./surface_flows), which consist of [_data sources_](./surface_data) flowing through [_operators_](./surface_ops_gen).

<>{/* TODO(mingwei): In the [DFIR Types](surface_types.md) chapter we dive into the details of the data types that pass through flows. */}</>

As a teaser, here is a Rust/DFIR "HELLO WORLD" program:

<CodeBlock language="rust" showLineNumbers>{exampleCode}</CodeBlock>

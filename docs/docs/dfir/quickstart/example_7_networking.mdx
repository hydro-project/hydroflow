# Networked Services

DFIR provides a robust framework for developing networked services. The best way to get started is to use
the DFIR template.

```bash
cargo generate gh:hydro-project/hydroflow template/dfir
```

`cd` into the generated folder, ensure the correct nightly version of rust is installed, and test the generated project:
```bash
#shell-command-next-line
cd <my-project>
#shell-command-next-line
rustup update
#shell-command-next-line
cargo test
```

The template contains a chat server & client implementation using UDP. You can start multiple instances of
the client and connect to the same server.

## Things to Check
* [README](https://github.com/hydro-project/hydroflow/tree/main/template/dfir#readme) - Contains instructions on building the template and
running the client and server examples.
* [server.rs](https://github.com/hydro-project/hydroflow/blob/main/template/dfir/src/server.rs) - Contains the chat server
implementation. The inline rust documentation explains the networking-related DFIR operators and their usage.
* [client.rs](https://github.com/hydro-project/hydroflow/blob/main/template/dfir/src/client.rs) - Contains the chat client
implementation. The inline rust documentation explains the networking-related DFIR operators and their usage.

DFIR also supports TCP for reliable, connection-oriented communication. Understanding the differences and use
cases of these protocols can help you choose the right one for your networked service.

## Additional Examples

The DFIR examples directory contains additional examples that deal with networking. For example, the [Randomized
Gossip Server](https://github.com/hydro-project/hydroflow/blob/main/dfir_rs/examples/chat/randomized_gossiping_server.rs)
example extends the chat example to work with a cluster of redundant servers that use gossip for sharing chat-related
state between themselves.

# An Example With Streaming Input
> In this example we will cover:
> - the input `channel` concept, which streams data in from outside the DFIR spec
> - the [`source_stream`](../syntax/surface_ops_gen.md#source_stream) operator that brings channel input into DFIR
> - Rust syntax to programmatically send data to a (local) channel

In our previous examples, data came from within the DFIR spec, via Rust iterators and the [`source_iter`](../syntax/surface_ops_gen.md#source_iter) operator. In most cases, however, data comes from outside the DFIR spec. In this example, we'll see a simple version of this idea, with data being generated on the same thread and sent into the channel programmatically via Rust.

For discussion, we start with a skeleton much like before:

```rust showLineNumbers
use dfir_rs::dfir_syntax;

pub fn main() {
    let mut dfir = dfir_syntax! {
        // code will go here
    };

    dfir.run_available();
}
```

**TODO:** Make the following less intimidating to users who are not Tokio experts.

To add a new external input
channel, we can use the `dfir_rs::util::unbounded_channel()` function in Rust before we declare the DFIR spec:

<CodeBlock language="rust">{getLines(exampleCode, 4, 5)}</CodeBlock>

Under the covers, this is a [multiple-producer/single-consumer (`mpsc`) channel](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/sync/mpsc/fn.unbounded_channel.html)
provided by the [tokio](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio) library for Rust, which is usually the appropriate choice for an inbound DFIR stream.
Think of it as a high-performance "mailbox" that any sender can fill with well-typed data.

The Rust `::<usize>` syntax uses what is affectionately
called the ["turbofish"](https://turbo.fish/about), which is how type parameters (generic arguments) are
supplied to generic types and functions. In this case it specifies that this tokio channel
transmits items of type `usize`.
The returned `example_recv` value can be used via a [`source_stream`](../syntax/surface_ops_gen.md#source_stream)
to build a DFIR subgraph just like before.

Here is the same program as before, but using the
input channel. Back in the `simple` project, replace the contents of `src/main.rs` with the following:

<CodeBlock language="rust" showLineNumbers>{exampleCode}</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock language="console">{extractOutput(exampleOutput)}</CodeBlock>

At the bottom of `main.rs` we can see how to programatically supply `usize`-typed inputs with the tokio
[`.send()`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/sync/mpsc/struct.UnboundedSender.html#method.send) method.
We call Rust's [`.unwrap()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html#method.unwrap) method
to ignore the error messages from `.send()` in this simple case.  In later examples we'll see how to
allow for data coming in over a network.

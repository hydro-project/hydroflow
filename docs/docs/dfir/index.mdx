# Introduction

<DFIRDocs />

## This Book
This book will teach you how to set up your environment to get started with DFIR, and how to program in the DFIR surface syntax.

Keep in mind that DFIR is under active development. However the code in this book is tested with the DFIR library so should always be up-to-date.

If you have any questions, feel free to [create an issue on Github](https://github.com/hydro-project/hydroflow/issues/new).

# Clusters
A key restriction of processes in Hydroflow+ is that there can only be one instance of the computation assigned to each process across the entire distributed system. This is fine for simple applications with only pipelined computation, but for scaling out we need the ability to have _multiple instances of the same computation_ running in parallel.

Clusters solve this by providing an nearly-identical API to processes, but representing a **set of instances** running the same computation instead of a single one. What changes when using a cluster is sending data, since we need to specify _which_ instance(s) of the computation to send the data to.

## Computing on Clusters
Instantiating clusters is done using the `cluster` method on `FlowBuilder`, taking a `ClusterSpec`:
```rust
pub fn my_flow<'a, D: Deploy<'a>>(
    flow: &FlowBuilder<'a, D>,
    cluster_spec: &impl ClusterSpec<'a, D>
) {
    let cluster = flow.cluster(cluster_spec);
}
```

This API follows the same pattern as processes, where a cluster spec represents a _template_ for a cluster, which can be instantiated multiple times to create multiple clusters.

Instantiating streams on clusters uses the same APIs as streams: `source_iter` and `source_stream` are both available. But when using these APIs, the root streams will be instantiated on _all_ instances in the cluster.

```rust
let stream = cluster.source_iter(q!(vec![1, 2, 3]));

stream.for_each(q!(|x| println!("{}", x)))
// will print 1, 2, 3 on **each** instance
```

## Sending Data
Because clusters represent a set of instances, adding networking requires us to specify _which_ instance(s) to send data to. Clusters provide different types depending on if the source or receiver is a cluster or a process.

Elements in a cluster are identified by a **cluster ID** (a `ClusterId<C>` where `C` is the typetag of the cluster). To get the IDs of all instances in a cluster, use the `members` method on cluster, which returns a runtime expression of type `&Vec<ClusterId<_>>` (which can only be used inside `q!()` or as an argument to `source_iter`). All IDs always are ranging from 0 through the length of the IDs vector.

This can then be passed into `source_iter` to load the IDs into the graph.
```rust
let stream = process.source_iter(cluster.members()).cloned();
```

### One-to-Many
When sending data from a process to a cluster, the source must be a stream of tuples of the form `(ClusterId<_>, T)` and sends each `T` element to the instance with the matching ID.

This is useful for partitioning data across instances. For example, we can partition a stream of elements in a round-robin fashion by using `enumerate` to add a sequence number to each element, then using `send_bincode` to send each element to the instance with the matching sequence number:
```rust
let cluster_ids = cluster.members();
let stream = process.source_iter(q!(vec![123, 456, 789]))
    .enumerate()
    .map(q!(|(i, x)| (
        ClusterId::from_raw(i % cluster_ids.len() as u32),
        x
    )))
    .send_bincode(&cluster);
```

To broadcast data to all instances in a cluster, use `broadcast_{bincode,bytes}`, which acts as a shortcut for the cross product.

```rust
let stream = process.source_iter(q!(vec![123, 456, 789]))
    .broadcast_bincode(&cluster);
```

### Many-to-One
In the other direction, sending data from a cluster to a process, we have a stream of elements of type `T` at the sender but on the recipient side we get a stream of tuples of the form `(u32, T)`, where the `u32` is the ID of the instance that sent the element. The elements received from different instances will be interleaved.

This is useful for aggregating data from multiple instances into a single stream. For example, we can use `send_bincode` to send data from all instances to a single process, and then print them all out:
```rust
let stream = cluster.source_iter(q!(vec![123, 456, 789]))
    .send_bincode(&process)
    .for_each(q!(|(id, x)| println!("{}: {}", id, x)));
```

If you don't care which instance sent the data, you can use `send_{bincode,bytes}_interleaved`, where the recipient receives a stream of `T` elements, but the elements received from different instances will be interleaved.
```rust
let stream = cluster.source_iter(q!(vec![123, 456, 789]))
    .send_bincode_interleaved(&process)
    .for_each(q!(|x| println!("{}", x)));
```

### Many-to-Many
Finally, when sending data from one cluster to another (or to itself as in distributed protocols), the source emits tuples of the form `(u32, T)` and sends each `T` element to the instance with the matching `u32` ID, but the recipient also gets `(u32, T)` tuples with the ID of the sender.

We can use the same shortcuts as before. For example, we can use `broadcast_bincode_interleaved` to send data from all instances in a cluster to all instances in another cluster, and then print them all out:
```rust
let stream = cluster1.source_iter(q!(vec![123, 456, 789]))
    .broadcast_bincode_interleaved(&cluster2)
    .for_each(q!(|x| println!("{}", x)));
```

# Processes and Streams
Hydroflow+ involves two main concepts:
- **Processes**, which represent _where_ elements of a dataflow program are processed
- **Streams**, which define _what_ is being computed

By combining the two, Hydroflow+ makes it possible to implement both low-level distributed protocols and high-level dataflow programs using the same API, all while supporting compile-time checks to guard against unexpected sources of nondeterminism.

## Processes
Unlike most streaming systems, Hydroflow+ requires that all streams be associated with a particular **process**. A process is a logical unit of computation that can be deployed to a single machine. Processes are most closely related to _actors_ in actor-based systems, but use streaming operators rather than an imperative API.

To create a process, we must take a `ProcessSpec` as an argument to our function. This trait abstracts over what the dataflow graph is being built for: compilation to a Rust binary or deployment.

```rust
pub fn my_flow<'a, D: Deploy<'a>>(
    flow: &FlowBuilder<'a, D>,
    process_spec: &impl ProcessSpec<'a, D>
) {
    ...
}
```

Process specs represent a _template_ for a process, which can be instantiated multiple times to create multiple processes. Multiple process specs can be useful to specify deployment characteristics for different sets of processes, such as deploying them to different cloud providers or regions.

Instantiating a process from a process spec is done using the `process` method on `FlowBuilder`:

```rust
let process = flow.process(process_spec);
```

## Streams
Streams are infinite ordered sequences of elements. They can be transformed using functional operators such as `map` and `filter`, relational operators such as `join`, and can be connected across processes using `send_to`.

### Instantiating Streams
Root streams are created using methods available on an an instantiated process.

#### `source_iter`
To create a stream from a Rust iterator, use `source_iter`. This is useful for loading static data into the graph. Each element of the iterator will be emitted _exactly once_ in the _first tick_ of execution (see [Aggregations and Ticks](./aggregations.mdx)).

```rust
let stream = process.source_iter(q!(vec![1, 2, 3]));
```

#### `source_stream`
To create a stream from an asynchronous source, use `source_stream`. This takes any type that implements `futures::Stream` and emits each element as it is received. This is useful for loading data from external sources such as Kafka or a database. Typically, you will want to take the stream as a `RuntimeData` parameter to your function, and pass the stream in your runtime binary.

```rust
pub fn my_flow<'a, D: Deploy<'a>>(
    ...,
    my_stream: RuntimeData<impl Stream<Item = i32>>
) {
    let stream = process.source_stream(my_stream);
    ...
}
```

### Sending Streams between Processes
To send a stream from one process to another, use the `send_*` methods on the source stream. This takes a parameter of the process to send the data to.

If sending a type that supports serialization using `serde`, use `send_bincode`, which uses the `bincode` crate to serialize the data.

```rust
let process0 = flow.process(process_spec);
let process1 = flow.process(process_spec);

let stream0 = process0.source_iter(...);
let stream1 = stream0.send_bincode(&process1);
```

To use custom serializers, you can use the `send_bytes` method to send a stream of `Bytes` values.

```rust
let stream0 = process0.source_iter(...);
let stream1 = stream0.send_bytes(&process1);
```

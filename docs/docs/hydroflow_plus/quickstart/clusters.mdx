# Scaling with Clusters
So far, we have looked at distributed systems where there is a single process running each piece of the compute graph -- **compute parallelism** (like pipelining). However, we can also use Hydroflow+ to run the same computation on multiple processes -- achieving **data parallelism** (like replication and partitioning). This is done by creating a **cluster** of processes that all run the same subgraph.

## Creating Clusters
Just like we use `ProcessSpec` to create processes, we use `ClusterSpec` to create clusters. We can then use the `flow.cluster(spec)` method to instantiate a cluster in our graph. Let's create a simple application where a leader process broadcasts data to a cluster of workers.

We start with the standard architecture, with a flow graph and a runtime entrypoint, but now take a cluster spec in addition to a process spec.

:::tip

If you have been following along with the Hydroflow+ template, you'll now need to declare a new module for this example. Create a new file at `flow/src/broadcast.rs` and add the following to `flow/src/lib.rs`:

```rust title="flow/src/lib.rs"
pub mod broadcast;
```

:::


```rust title="flow/src/broadcast.rs"
use hydroflow_plus::*;
use stageleft::*;

pub struct Leader {}
pub struct Workers {}

pub fn broadcast(
    flow: &FlowBuilder,
) -> (Process<Leader>, Cluster<Workers>) {
    let leader = flow.process();
    let workers = flow.cluster();

    // ...

    (leader, workers)
}
```

## Broadcasting Data
When sending data between individual processes, we used the `send_bincode` operator. When sending data from a process to a cluster, we can use the `broadcast_bincode` operator instead.

```rust
let data = flow.source_iter(&leader, q!(0..10));
data
    .broadcast_bincode(&workers)
    .for_each(q!(|n| println!("{}", n)));
```

The `Stream` returned by `broadcast_bincode` represents the data received on _each_ process in the cluster. Because all processes in a cluster run the exact same computation, we can then use the `for_each` operator directly on that stream to print the data on each process.

## Deploying Graphs with Clusters
To deploy this application, we must set up the runtime entrypoint and the Hydro Deploy configuration. The entrypoint looks similar to before, but now uses the CLI data to instantiate the cluster as well.

```rust title="flow/src/broadcast.rs"
use hydroflow_plus::util::cli::HydroCLI;
use hydroflow_plus_cli_integration::{CLIRuntime, HydroflowPlusMeta};

#[stageleft::entry]
pub fn broadcast_runtime<'a>(
    flow: FlowBuilder<'a>,
    cli: RuntimeData<&'a HydroCLI<HydroflowPlusMeta>>,
) -> impl Quoted<'a, Hydroflow<'a>> {
    broadcast(&flow);
    flow.with_default_optimize()
        .compile::<CLIRuntime>()
        .with_dynamic_id(q!(cli.meta.subgraph_id))
}
```

Our binary (`src/bin/broadcast.rs`) looks similar to before:

```rust title="flow/src/bin/broadcast.rs"
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let ports = hydroflow_plus::util::cli::init().await;

    hydroflow_plus::util::cli::launch_flow(
        flow::broadcast::broadcast_runtime!(&ports)
    ).await;
}
```

Finally, our deployment script (`examples/broadcast.rs`) instantiates multiple services for the leader process and the workers. Because we are sharing the deployment across multiple builders, we wrap it in a `RefCell`. Since this script defines the physical deployment, we explicitly instantiate multiple services for the cluster spec, returning a `Vec` of services. We also set a display name for each service so that we can tell them apart in the logs.

```rust title="flow/examples/broadcast.rs"
use std::cell::RefCell;

use hydro_deploy::{Deployment, HydroflowCrate};
use hydroflow_plus_cli_integration::{DeployProcessSpec, DeployClusterSpec};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let mut deployment = Deployment::new();
    let profile = "dev";

    let builder = hydroflow_plus::FlowBuilder::new();
    let (leader, workers) = flow::broadcast::broadcast(&builder);

    flow.with_default_optimize()
        .with_process(&leader, DeployProcessSpec::new({
            HydroflowCrate::new(".", deployment.Localhost())
                .bin("broadcast")
                .profile(profile)
                .display_name("leader")
        }))
        .with_cluster(&workers, DeployClusterSpec::new({
            (0..2)
                .map(|idx| {
                    HydroflowCrate::new(".", deployment.Localhost())
                        .bin("broadcast")
                        .profile(profile)
                        .display_name(format!("worker/{}", idx))
                })
                .collect()
        }))
        .deploy(&mut deployment);

    deployment.run_ctrl_c().await.unwrap();
}
```

If we run this script, we should see the following output:

```bash
#shell-command-next-line
cargo run -p flow --example broadcast
[worker/0] 0
[worker/1] 0
[worker/0] 1
[worker/1] 1
...
```

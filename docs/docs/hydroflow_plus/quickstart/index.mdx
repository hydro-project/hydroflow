# Quickstart
In this tutorial, we'll walk through the basics of Hydroflow+ by building a simple dataflow that prints out the first 10 natural numbers. We'll start with a single process, then pipeline the computation, and finally distribute it across a cluster.

To get started with a new project, we'll use the Hydroflow+ template. The template comes with a simple distributed program.

```bash
#shell-command-next-line
cargo install cargo-generate
#shell-command-next-line
cargo generate gh:hydro-project/hydroflow template/hydroflow_plus
# Project Name: my-example-project
#shell-command-next-line
cd my-example-project
```

After `cd`ing into the generated folder, we can run tests for the included sample:
```bash
#shell-command-next-line
cargo test
```

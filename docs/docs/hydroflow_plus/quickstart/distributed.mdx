# Adding Distribution
Continuing from our previous example, we will now look at how to deploy our program to run on multiple processes. First, we need to extend our dataflow program to use multiple processes with a network between them.

We'll start by updating our function signature to take two processes. At this point, we'll need to add a lifetime parameter `'a` which represents the lifetime of data referenced by our dataflow logic. This lifetime needs to be the same across all the processes, so it can't be elided.

```rust title="src/first_ten_distributed.rs"
use hydroflow_plus::*;

pub fn first_ten_distributed<'a>(p1: &Process<'a>, p2: &Process<'a>)
```

Now, we'll use a new API, `send_bincode` to establish a network between our processes. Given a stream on process `p1`, we can send the data to `p2` by calling `.send_bincode(p2)`, which returns a stream on `p2`. So to make our program distributed, it only takes a single line change.

```rust title="src/first_ten_distributed.rs"
pub fn first_ten_distributed<'a>(p1: &Process<'a>, p2: &Process<'a>) {
    p1.source_iter(q!(0..10))
        // highlight-next-line
        .send_bincode(p2)
        .for_each(q!(|n| println!("{}", n)));
}
```

Then, we can update our deployment script to launch both processes on localhost. Hydro Deploy will automatically handle service discovery and networking, since it knows the full network topology (on UNIX systems, this will use a UNIX socket for networking).

<CodeBlock language="rust" title="examples/first_ten_distributed.rs">{firstTenDistExample}</CodeBlock>

We can then launch the program:
```bash
#shell-command-next-line
cargo run --example first_ten_distributed
[() (process 1)] 0
[() (process 1)] 1
[() (process 1)] 2
[() (process 1)] 3
[() (process 1)] 4
[() (process 1)] 5
[() (process 1)] 6
[() (process 1)] 7
[() (process 1)] 8
[() (process 1)] 9     
```

You'll notice that our logs are not particularly descriptive, just showing `()` as an identifier. Furthermore, our processes have the same Rust type, which could lead to accidentally mixing up streams across the machines (this will throw an exception, but it would be nice to have a compile error).

To fix this, we can use the optional type parameter on `Process`, which lets us add a "type tag" that acts as an identifier. We'll define two structs to act as these tags and use them in the function signature:

<CodeBlock language="rust" title="src/first_ten_distributed.rs">{getLines(firstTenDistSrc, 3, 10)}</CodeBlock>

If you are using an IDE extension like [Rust Analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/), you'll see these types attached to each stream. And if we launch the program again, we'll see much better logs:

```bash
#shell-command-next-line
cargo run --example first_ten_distributed
[first_ten_distributed::P2 (process 1)] 0
[first_ten_distributed::P2 (process 1)] 1
[first_ten_distributed::P2 (process 1)] 2
[first_ten_distributed::P2 (process 1)] 3
[first_ten_distributed::P2 (process 1)] 4
[first_ten_distributed::P2 (process 1)] 5
[first_ten_distributed::P2 (process 1)] 6
[first_ten_distributed::P2 (process 1)] 7
[first_ten_distributed::P2 (process 1)] 8
[first_ten_distributed::P2 (process 1)] 9
```

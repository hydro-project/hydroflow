# Aggregations and Ticks
Hydroflow+ streams support aggregation operators such as `fold()`, which can be used to compute results that combine information from multiple elements along a stream. However, because Hydroflow+ streams are infinite, these operators have slightly different semantics than typical implementations.

In particular, Hydroflow (and Hydroflow+) adhere to a _tick_ model of computation, where the stream is chunked into finite _ticks_ of data. At the beginning of each tick on each node (ticks are **not** synchronized), a batch of inputs are collected, the local dataflow graph is executed, and a batch of outputs are produced. This enables Hydroflow to support infinite streams while still being able to apply optimizations such as vectorization.

## Specifying Windows
For most operators, such as `map` and `filter`, which operate on each element independently, the tick model is transparent. However, for operators that combine multiple elements, such as `fold`, the tick model is more visible. In particular, developers must explicitly specify whether they want aggregations such as `fold` or multi-stream operators such as `join` to operate over the latest batch of data or all data since the beginning of the stream.

:::note

Hydroflow+ tracks windows using the `W` type parameter on `Stream`. For streams with an unspecified window, this type will be `Async`, but with a window it will be `Windowed`. This guards against accidental aggregations since the type system will prevent you from aggregating over a stream with an `Async` window.

:::

To specify this **window**, Hydroflow+ offers two operators, `tick_batch()` and `all_ticks()`. The former specifies that the operator should operate over the latest batch of data, while the latter specifies that the operator should operate over all data since the beginning of the stream.

For example, consider a pipelined aggregation across two nodes. We can sum up elements on the first node in a batched manner using `tick_batch()`, then sum up the results on the second node in an unbounded manner using `all_ticks()`:

```rust
let root_stream = node.source_stream(q!(1..=10));
root_stream
    .tick_batch()
    .fold(q!(|| 0), q!(|acc, x| *acc += x))
    .send_bincode(&node2);
    .all_ticks()
    .fold(q!(|| 0), q!(|acc, x| acc + x));
```

Note that Hydroflow+ streams are still unbounded! The `all_ticks()` operator does not wait until all elements are received, instead on each tick it will operate over all data since the beginning of the stream.

So if we were to pass in inputs 1, 2, 3, we might get the following results on node 2:
```
First Tick: 0
Second Tick: (1 + 2) = 3
Third Tick: (1 + 2) + (3) = 6
```

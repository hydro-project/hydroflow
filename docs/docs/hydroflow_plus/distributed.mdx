# Distributed Hydroflow+
Continuing from our previous example, we will now look at how to extend our program to run on multiple nodes. Recall that our previous flow graph looked like this:

```rust title="flow/src/first_ten.rs"
use hydroflow_plus::*;
use hydroflow_plus::node::*;
use stageleft::*;

pub fn first_ten<'a, D: LocalDeploy<'a>>(
    graph: &'a GraphBuilder<'a, D>,
    node_builder: &impl NodeBuilder<'a, D>
) {
    let node = graph.node(node_builder);
    let numbers = node.source_iter(q!(0..10));
    numbers.for_each(q!(|n| println!("{}", n)));
}
```

## The Flow Graph
Let's extend this example to print the numbers on a separate node. First, we need to specify that our flow graph will involve the network. We do this by replacing the `LocalDeploy<'a>` trait bound with the general `Deploy<'a>`. Then, we can use the `node_builder` to create a second node:
```rust title="flow/src/first_ten_distributed.rs"
use hydroflow_plus::*;
use hydroflow_plus::node::*;
use stageleft::*;

pub fn first_ten_distributed<'a, D: Deploy<'a>>(
    graph: &'a GraphBuilder<'a, D>,
    node_builder: &impl NodeBuilder<'a, D>
) {
    let node = graph.node(node_builder);
    let second_node = graph.node(node_builder);
}
```

Now, we can distribute our dataflow by using the `send_bincode` operator to mark where the data should be sent using bincode serialization.

```rust
let numbers = node.source_iter(q!(0..10));
numbers
    .send_bincode(&second_node)
    .for_each(q!(|n| println!("{}", n)));
```

## The Runtime
Now that our graph spans multiple nodes, our runtime entrypoint will involve multiple subgraphs. This means we can't get away with `build_single`. Instead, we must take the subgraph ID as a runtime parameter (`subgraph_id`) to select the appropriate graph. In addition, our dataflow involves the network, so we take a `HydroCLI` runtime parameter (`cli`) so that nodes can look up their network connections and instantiate the flow graph with access to it.

```rust title="flow/src/first_ten_distributed.rs"
use hydroflow_plus::util::cli::HydroCLI;
use hydroflow_plus_cli_integration::{CLIRuntime, HydroflowPlusMeta};

#[stageleft::entry]
pub fn first_ten_distributed_runtime<'a>(
    graph: &'a GraphBuilder<'a, CLIRuntime>,
    cli: RuntimeData<&'a HydroCLI<HydroflowPlusMeta>>,
) -> impl Quoted<'a, Hydroflow<'a>> {
    let _ = first_ten_distributed(graph, &cli);
    graph.build(q!(cli.meta.subgraph_id))
}
```

The corresponding binary in `src/bin/first_ten_distributed.rs` then instantiates the CLI and reads the node ID from the command line arguments:

```rust title="flow/src/bin/first_ten_distributed.rs"
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let ports = hydroflow_plus::util::cli::init().await;

    hydroflow_plus::util::cli::launch_flow(
        flow::first_ten_distributed_runtime!(&ports)
    ).await;
}
```

## The Deployment
Finally, we need to deploy our dataflow with the appropriate network topology. We achieve this by using [Hydro Deploy](../deploy/index.md). Hydroflow+ integrates with Hydro Deploy to automatically construct the topology based on the flow graph. We can create a new file `examples/first_ten_distributed.rs` with the following contents:

```rust title="flow/examples/first_ten_distributed.rs"
use hydro_deploy::{Deployment, HydroflowCrate};
use hydroflow_plus_cli_integration::CLIDeployNodeBuilder;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let mut deployment = Deployment::new();
    let localhost = deployment.Localhost();

    let builder = hydroflow_plus::GraphBuilder::new();
    flow::first_ten::first_ten_distributed(
        &builder,
        &CLIDeployNodeBuilder::new(|| {
            deployment.add_service(
                HydroflowCrate::new(".", localhost.clone())
                    .bin("first_ten_distributed")
                    .profile("dev"),
            )
        }),
    );

    deployment.deploy().await.unwrap();

    deployment.start().await.unwrap();

    tokio::signal::ctrl_c().await.unwrap()
}
```

Most importantly, we specify a `CLIDeployNodeBuilder`, which takes a closure that constructs a Hydro Deploy node for each node in the flow graph. In our case, we use the `HydroflowCrate` node type, which deploys a Hydroflow+ binary. We also specify the node ID as a command line argument, which is read by our runtime binary.

We can then run our distributed dataflow with:

```bash
$ cargo run -p flow --example first_ten_distributed
[service/1] 0
[service/1] 1
[service/1] 2
[service/1] 3
[service/1] 4
[service/1] 5
[service/1] 6
[service/1] 7
[service/1] 8
[service/1] 9
```

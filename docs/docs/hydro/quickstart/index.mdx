# Quickstart
In this tutorial, we'll walk through the basics of Hydro by building a simple dataflow that prints out the first 10 natural numbers. We'll start with a single process, then pipeline the computation, and finally distribute it across a cluster.

:::tip

First you will need to install Rust. We recommend the conventional installation
method, `rustup`, which allows you to easily manage and update Rust versions: [**Install Rust**](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

The link in the previous line will take you to the Rust website that shows you how to
install `rustup` and the Rust package manager `cargo` (and the
internally-used `rustc` compiler). `cargo` is Rust's main development tool,
used for building, running, and testing Rust code.

We recommend using VS Code with the `rust-analyzer` extension (and NOT the
`Rust` extension).

## Getting Started with Hydro
To get started with a new project, we'll use the Hydro template. The template comes with a simple distributed program.

```bash
#shell-command-next-line
cargo install cargo-generate
#shell-command-next-line
cargo generate gh:hydro-project/hydro-template
# Project Name: my-example-project
#shell-command-next-line
cd my-example-project
```

After `cd`ing into the generated folder, we can run tests for the included sample:
```bash
#shell-command-next-line
cargo test
```

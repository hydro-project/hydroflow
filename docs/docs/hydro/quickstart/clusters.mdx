# Scaling with Clusters
So far, we have looked at distributed systems where each process is running a different piece of the compute graph -- **compute parallelism**. However, we can also use Hydro to run the same computation on multiple processes -- achieving **data parallelism** (e.g. partitioning). This is done by creating a **cluster** of processes that all run the same subgraph of code.

## Dataflow with Clusters
Just like we use the `Process` type to represent a virtual handle to a single node, we can use the **`Cluster`** type to represent a handle to a **set of nodes** (with size unknown at compile-time).

A `Stream` located on a `Cluster` can be thought of as SIMD-style programming, where each cluster member executes the same operators but on different pieces of data.

To start, we set up a new module in `src/first_ten_cluster.rs` with a dataflow program that takes in a `Process` for a leader and `Cluster` for a set of workers.

<CodeBlock language="rust" title="src/first_ten_cluster.rs">{getLines(firstTenClusterSrc, 1, 6)}</CodeBlock>

We start by materializing a stream of numbers on the `leader`, as before. But rather than sending the stream to a single process, we will instead _distribute_ the data to each member of the cluster using `round_robin_bincode`. This API places data on a `cluster` in a round-robin fashion by using the order of elements to determine which cluster member each element is sent to.

:::info

There are a [variety of APIs](pathname:///rustdoc/hydro_lang/stream/struct.Stream.html#impl-Stream%3CT,+L,+B%3E-2) for sending data to and receiving data from clusters. For example, we `broadcast_bincode` to send copies to all members (e.g. for replication), or use `send_bincode` if we have a custom partitioning algorithm.

On each cluster member, we will then do some work to transform the data (using `map`) and log the transformed values locally (using `inspect`, which is useful for debugging).

<CodeBlock language="rust" title="src/first_ten_cluster.rs">{getLines(firstTenClusterSrc, 10, 11)}</CodeBlock>

Finally, we will send the data back to the leader. We achieve this using a variant of the APIs from before: `send_bincode_interleaved`. If we used `send_bincode`, we would get a stream of (cluster ID, data) tuples. Since it is a common pattern to ignore the IDs, `send_bincode_interleaved` is available as a helper.

## Deploying Clusters
Deployment scripts are similar to before, except that when provisioning a cluster we provide a list of deployment hosts rather than a single one. In our example, we'll launch 4 nodes for the cluster by creating a `Vec` of 4 localhost instances.

<CodeBlock language="rust" title="examples/first_ten_cluster.rs">{highlightLines(firstTenClusterExample, [14])}</CodeBlock>

We can then launch the program:
```bash
#shell-command-next-line
cargo run --example first_ten_cluster
#highlight-next-line
[hydro_template::first_ten_cluster::Worker (cluster 1) / 0] 0
[hydro_template::first_ten_cluster::Worker (cluster 1) / 2] 4
[hydro_template::first_ten_cluster::Worker (cluster 1) / 2] 12
#highlight-next-line
[hydro_template::first_ten_cluster::Worker (cluster 1) / 0] 8
[hydro_template::first_ten_cluster::Worker (cluster 1) / 3] 6
[hydro_template::first_ten_cluster::Worker (cluster 1) / 1] 2
[hydro_template::first_ten_cluster::Worker (cluster 1) / 1] 10
[hydro_template::first_ten_cluster::Worker (cluster 1) / 1] 18
[hydro_template::first_ten_cluster::Leader (process 0)] 0
#highlight-next-line
[hydro_template::first_ten_cluster::Worker (cluster 1) / 0] 16
[hydro_template::first_ten_cluster::Worker (cluster 1) / 3] 14
[hydro_template::first_ten_cluster::Leader (process 0)] 8
[hydro_template::first_ten_cluster::Leader (process 0)] 16
[hydro_template::first_ten_cluster::Leader (process 0)] 2
[hydro_template::first_ten_cluster::Leader (process 0)] 10
[hydro_template::first_ten_cluster::Leader (process 0)] 18
[hydro_template::first_ten_cluster::Leader (process 0)] 4
[hydro_template::first_ten_cluster::Leader (process 0)] 12
[hydro_template::first_ten_cluster::Leader (process 0)] 6
[hydro_template::first_ten_cluster::Leader (process 0)] 14
```

You'll notice the round-robin distribution in action here, as each cluster log is tagged with the ID of the member (e.g. `/ 0`). In our deployment, we are sending data round-robin across 4 members of the cluster, numbered `0` through `3`.  Hence cluster member `0` receives values `0`, `4`, `8` (corresponding to the highlighted lines),  member `1`  receives values `1`, `5`, `9`, and so on.

# Introduction
Hydro is a high-level distributed programming framework for Rust powered by the [DFIR runtime](../dfir/index.mdx). Unlike traditional architectures such as actors or RPCs, Hydro offers _choreographic_ APIs, where expressions and functions can describe computation that takes place across many locations. It also integrates with [Hydro Deploy](../deploy/index.md) to make it easy to deploy and run Hydro programs to the cloud.

Hydro uses a two-stage compilation approach. Hydro programs are standard Rust programs, which first run on the developer's laptop to generate a _deployment plan_. This plan is then compiled to individual binaries for each machine in the distributed system (enabling zero-overhead abstractions), and are then deployed to the cloud using the generated plan along with specifications of cloud resources.

Hydro has been used to write a variety of high-performance distributed systems, including implementations of classic distributed protocols such as two-phase commit and Paxos. Work is ongoing to develop a distributed systems standard library that will offer these protocols and more as reusable components.

The docs for Hydro are still a work in progress. If you have any questions or run into bugs, please file an issue on the [Hydroflow GitHub repository](https://github.com/hydro-project/hydroflow).

## 0.10.0 (2024-11-08)

### Chore

 - <csr-id-4f6d400d0992594f8f12992fb6939378b12fadd6/> update rust-sitter
   The latest Rust Sitter drops the dependency on `tree-sitter-cli`, which
   eliminates many transitive dependencies.
 - <csr-id-d5677604e93c07a5392f4229af94a0b736eca382/> update pinned rust version, clippy lints, remove some dead code

### Style

 - <csr-id-8442d1b524621a9f8b43372a9c25991efb33c25e/> fixes for latest nightly clippy

## 0.8.0 (2024-07-23)

<csr-id-67c0e51fb25ea1a2e3aae197c1984920b46759fa/>

### New Features

 - <csr-id-b3d01c20cae2335a3da2c02343debe677f17786b/> add `#[derive(Lattice)]` derive macros, fix #1247
   This adds derive macros to allow user-created macros. Each field must be
   a lattice.
   
   Example usage:
   ```rust
   struct MyLattice<KeySet, Epoch>
   where
   KeySet: Collection,
   Epoch: Ord,
   {
   keys: SetUnion<KeySet>,
   epoch: Max<Epoch>,
   }
   ```
   
   Uses `#[derive(Lattice)]` for the `lattices` library `Pair` lattice.
   Also contains some cleanup in the `lattices` crate.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-f91c30045dfdf92cf3d383676875d9e749cb8d93/> add `add_state_tick` to state API, reset at end of each tick, fix #1298
   Option 2 of #1298
   
   * Main feature in the title is in `src/scheduled/{context,graph}.rs`
* Codegen for some stateful operators (those which can be used as singletons, and some others) is changed to use the new API.
* Add a test `test_cartesian_product_tick_state` for #1298
* Rest of the diff is snapshot changes

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-755e8a6d2c2b30b5d28b60315bb099030d3f3964/> remove singleton referencer `persist::<'static>()` insertion
   Also enables singletons for `persist()` and ensures that only the
   `'static` lifetime is used
   
   Singletons are supposed to act like `cross_join()`. I.e. if we have this
   code:
   ```rust
   stream -> filter(|item| ... #y ...) -> ...
   ```
   It should behave equivalently to
   ```rust
   stream -> cj[0];
   y -> cj[1];
   cj = cross_join() -> filter(|(item, y)| ...) -> ...
   ```
   
   This has a very unintuitive replaying behavior, if `y` receives multiple
   updates:
   1. `y` receives an item `10`
2. `stream` receives an item `20`
3. `(10, 20)` is emitted
4. `y` receives an item `11`
5. `(11, 20)` is emitted
   In this case the item `20` gets emitted twice.

### Refactor (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-67c0e51fb25ea1a2e3aae197c1984920b46759fa/> require lifetime on `perist*()` operators

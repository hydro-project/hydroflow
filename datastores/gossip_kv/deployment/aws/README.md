brew install kubernetes-cli
brew install k9s
```  

## Initialize Setup

```shell
make kubectl_setup

## K9s
To monitor the cluster using k9s, use the following command.

```shell
k9s
```

## Build & Upload Docker Image
Build and upload the docker image for the application, into ECR.
```shell
make upload_docker_images
```

## Create Application
```shell
make application
```

## Check if the application is running
```shell
kubectl get pods # All gossip-kv-* pods should show status as "Running"
````

```shell
make tunnel_grafana
```

## Access Prometheus
```shell
make tunnel_prometheus

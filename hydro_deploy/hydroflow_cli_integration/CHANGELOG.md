## Unreleased

### New Features

 - <csr-id-9e275824c88b24d060a7de5822e1359959b36b03/> auto-configure Hydro Deploy based on Hydroflow+ plans
 - <csr-id-e5bdd12e32d6ea72fd91a55c12e09f07a0edaa5c/> add initial test using Hydro CLI from Hydroflow+
   This also required a change to Hydroflow core to make it possible to run the dataflow itself on a single thread (using a LocalSet), even if the surrounding runtime is not single-threaded (required to work around deadlocks because we can't use async APIs inside Hydroflow+). This requires us to spawn any Hydroflow tasks (only for `dest_sink` at the moment) right next to when we run the dataflow rather than when the Hydroflow graph is initialized. From a conceptual perspective, this seems _more right_, since now creating a Hydroflow program will not result in any actual tasks running.
   
   In the third PR of this series, I aim to add a new Hydroflow+ operator that will automate the setup of a `dest_sink`/`source_stream` pair that span nodes.

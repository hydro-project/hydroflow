## v0.10.0 (2024-11-08)

### Chore

 - <csr-id-d5677604e93c07a5392f4229af94a0b736eca382/> update pinned rust version, clippy lints, remove some dead code

### New Features

 - <csr-id-afe78c343658472513b34d28658634b253148aee/> add ability to have staged flows inside unit tests
   Whenever a Hydroflow+ program is compiled, it depends on a generated
   `__staged` module, which contains the entire contents of the crate but
   with every type / function made `pub` and exported, so that the compiled
   UDFs can resolve local references appropriately.
   
   Previously, we would not do this for `#[cfg(test)]` modules, since they
   may use `dev-dependencies` and therefore the generated module may fail
   to compile when not in test mode. To solve this, when running a unit
   test (marked with `hydroflow_plus::deploy::init_test()`) that uses
   trybuild, we emit a version of the `__staged` module with `#[cfg(test)]`
   modules included _into the generated trybuild sources_ because we can
   guarantee via trybuild that the appropriate `dev-dependencies` are
   available.
   
   This by itself allows crates depending on `hydroflow_plus` to have local
   unit tests with Hydroflow+ logic inside them. But we also want to use
   this support for unit tests inside `hydroflow_plus` itself. To enable
   that, we eliminate the `hydroflow_plus_deploy` crate and move its
   contents directly to `hydroflow_plus` itself so that we can access the
   trybuild machinery without incurring a circular dependency.
   
   Also fixes #1408
 - <csr-id-8a809315cd37929687fcabc34a12042db25d5767/> add API for external network inputs
   This is a key step towards being able to unit-test HF+ graphs, by being
   able to have controlled inputs. Outputs next.

### Style

 - <csr-id-8442d1b524621a9f8b43372a9c25991efb33c25e/> fixes for latest nightly clippy

### Chore

 - <csr-id-a2ec110ccadb97e293b19d83a155d98d94224bba/> manually set versions for crates renamed in #1413
 - <csr-id-11af32828bab6e4a4264d2635ff71a12bb0bb778/> lower min dependency versions where possible, update `Cargo.lock`
   Moved from #1418

   * #1395
   * __->__ #1394

### Documentation

 - <csr-id-f5f1eb0c612f5c0c1752360d972ef6853c5e12f0/> cleanup doc comments for clippy latest

### New Features

 - <csr-id-6568263e03899d4e96837690e6e59284c194d7ff/> Add end-to-end flamegraph generation for macos and linux localhost, fix #1351
 - <csr-id-fedd3ef60fe16ab862244d816f7973269a7295e8/> improve progress UX by collapsing nested groups
   Now, when a group only has a single active task, we skip printing a line
   for the group itself and instead collapse its information into the line
   for the inner task (recursively as necessary). This allows us to show
   more fine grained progress without overflowing the console.
 - <csr-id-46a8a2cb08732bb21096e824bc4542d208c68fb2/> use trybuild to compile subgraph binaries

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-c4683caca43f2927694c920b43ef35a6d1629eaa/> only record usermode events in perf
   When kernel stacks are included, the DWARF traces can become corrupted /
   overflown leading to flamegraphs with broken parents. We only are
   interested in usermode, anyways, and can measure I/O overhead through
   other methods.
 - <csr-id-63b528feeb2e6dac2ed12c02b2e39e0d42133a74/> only instantiate `Localhost` once
 - <csr-id-654b77d8f65ae6eb62c164a2d736168ff96cb168/> avoid Terraform crashing on empty provider block

### Refactor

 - <csr-id-a88a550cefde3a56790859127edc6a4e27e07090/> adjust `ProgressTracker::println`
   A small refactor pulled out of the perf tracing work, barely related to
   #1359
 - <csr-id-77246e77df47a0006dcb3eaeeb76882efacfd25c/> cleanup handling of arc `Weak` in `deployment.rs`

### Style

 - <csr-id-3fde68d0db0414017cfb771a218b14b8f57d1686/> use `name_of!` macro

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-749a10307f4eff2a46a1056735e84ed94d44b39e/> Perf works over SSH

   [Notion](https://www.notion.so/hydro-project/perf-Measuring-CPU-usage-6135b6ce56a94af38eeeba0a55deef9c).

### Refactor (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-0a465e55dd39c76bc1aefb020460a639d792fe87/> rename integration crates to drop CLI references

   > I think before some refactors we took the I/O handles instead of using broadcast channels.
 - <csr-id-0feae7454e4674eea1f3308b3d6d4e9d459cda67/> build cache cleanup
   * Replace mystery tuple with new `struct BuildOutput`
   * Replace `Mutex` and `Arc`-infested `HashMap` with `memo-map` crate,

## v0.5.1 (2024-01-29)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-d23c2299098dd62058c0951c99a62bb9e0af5b25/> avoid inflexible `\\?\` canonical paths on windows to mitigate `/` separator errors
 - <csr-id-f8a0b95113e92e003061d2a3865c84d69851dd8e/> race conditions when handshake channels capture other outputs
   Timeouts in Hydroflow+ tests were being caused by a race condition in Hydro Deploy where stdout sent after a handshake message would sometimes be sent to the `cli_stdout` channel for handshakes.
   
   This PR adjusts the handshake channels to always be oneshot, so that the broadcaster immediately knows when to send data to the regular stdout channels.
   
   Also refactors Hydro Deploy sources to split up more modules.
 - <csr-id-1ae27de6aafb72cee5da0cce6cf52748161d0f33/> don't vendor openssl and fix docker build
 - <csr-id-1d8adc1df15bac74c6f4496589d615e361019f50/> fix docs and remove unnecessary async_trait
